# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James.  
I'm a graduate student currently pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Data Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, expected Summer 2025.

I have a strong foundation in mathematics, data analysis, and programming, with skills in SQL, Python, R, Excel, BI tools and more. My background includes statistical analysis, database management, and data visualization.

I use my expertise in statistical modeling, machine learning, and programming to work on data-driven projects. Iâ€™m passionate about applying these skills to solve real-world problems.
